# activity journal

This is a simple no-guarantee tool to create a journal of the notes of your own
intervals.icu activities.


# Installation

None (yet). For now, clone the git repository and run the scripts.


# Usage

1. Get your athlete ID and API key from the Developer settings at
   https://intervals.icu/settings .
2. Get your activities from i.icu and add them to your local database running
3. Create a PDF file of the data using `activity-journal.py`; this script
   creates a markdown file of the data and passes this through `pandoc`, which
   is thus necessary.


# Further comments

If you have any ideas on how to improve `activity journal` please let me know
or, preferably, create a pull request for improvements.
